namespace forloop

//for i in 0..argv.Length-1 do
//let person = argv.[i]
//printfn "Hello %s, Nice to meet you" person
// printfn "Thanks and Goodbye"
//0

//For loops with iterators a better approach

//for person in argv do
//printfn "Hello %s, Nice to meet you" person
// printfn "Thanks and Goodbye"
//0

//iterating with Array.iter

//let sayHello person =
//printfn "Hello %s from my f# program!" person

//let main argv =
//Array.iter SayHello argv
//printfn "Nice to meet you."
//0
